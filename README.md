- Describe 

this Design I download so don't care about the unnecessary link.

- How to run the program
first, you can see Admin in navbar has two sections Add & View for each section add is insert form and view table and search.
in shop.php you can add any product for user 1 and see it in cart.php.
after the end, you can go to checkout.php to see your bill.
unit test in checkout.php can see your 2 examples.
I use freeforexapi.com to get the latest EGP rate with the USA.

- Note for Discount
i design this discount database for a single condition and the single result so if want mult can make relation M to M 
if num_buy = 0 this means no condition to run this discount
